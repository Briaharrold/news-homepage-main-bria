I made a website Layout
Peer Reviewed by: Halley Pham 
Peer Review: This looks really good! The active/hover states are all there. Responsiveness also looks great, with the offcanvas/drawer navbar for mobile also there. The only thing I would recommend is hadding padding to the top and bottom for desktop since in the design image, it seems like there would be some space there. Great Job!! (:
